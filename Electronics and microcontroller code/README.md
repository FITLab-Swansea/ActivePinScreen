# Active PinScreen Electronics and Microcontroller
Active PinScreen is controlled using a custom-made circuit board, which runs a 8X8 pin array and a Bluetooth module, and provides handles battery charging.

## Getting Start
This repository provides [circuit diagrams](Gerber%20files/), a [bill of materials](Coil%20array%20BOM.xls) and [parts coordinates list](partslist_coil.xls), a [list of commands](Coils-protocol.pdf), and [general hardware documentation](pintoy_paper.pdf).

You will also need the following (or similar), in addition to the circuit board:

* A Bluetooth HC-05 module
* Two lithium-polymer battery
* Optional: Two DPST switchers (examples)
* Optional: Two extra 100 kOhm resistors for the battery monitor feature
