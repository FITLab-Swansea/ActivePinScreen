# Active PinScreen
Active PinScreen is a new tactile feedback technique, that applies localised stimuli on multiple fingers with fine spatial and temporal resolution. It uses an array of solenoid-actuated magnetic pins with millimetre scale form-factor which could be deployed for back-of-device handheld use without instrumenting the user.
## Getting Start
To build your own Active PinScreen, the following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live Active PinScreen.
### Prerequisites
As well as presenting a detailed description of the prototype, we provide the potential design configurations and the applications of Active PinScreen and evaluate the human factors of tactile interaction with multiple fingers in a controlled user evaluation.
