# Active PinScreen
Active PinScreen is a new tactile feedback technique, that applies localised stimuli on multiple fingers with fine spatial and temporal resolution. It uses an array of solenoid-actuated magnetic pins with millimetre scale form-factor which could be deployed for back-of-device handheld use without instrumenting the user.

See the [toolkit website](https://breaking-the-glass.com/toolkit.html) and [research project website](https://breaking-the-glass.com) for more details and related work.
## Getting Start
To build your own Active PinScreen, the following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live Active PinScreen.

As well as presenting a detailed description of the prototype, we provide the potential design configurations and the applications of Active PinScreen.
